## Hi, I’m Joel Saji

I’m a computer science student at the University of Houston with interests in software development, systems programming, and problem-solving. I enjoy building practical software, learning how systems work under the hood, and improving code through testing and debugging. I am especially interested in using programming to make tasks easier and automate the more mundane parts of living. 

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my foundations in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design while gaining hands-on experience through coursework and personal projects. I am also focused on building skills that will be especially useful for the longterm job market such as data analysis, using git effectively, and understanding different operating systems and tools. 

### What I’m working on
- Programming projects in Python, C++, and Java  
- Practicing algorithmic thinking and debugging strategies  
- Exploring systems and low-level programming concepts
- Putting learned knowledge to use building actual systems and programs  

### What I’m looking for
- Software engineering internships or entry-level roles  
- Opportunities to contribute to real-world projects  
- Collaborative environments where I can learn and grow
